# Weave Camera Morph V1

Weave Camera Morph V1 is a Blender add-on that allows users to create smooth camera transitions (morphs) between multiple cameras in a scene. This add-on provides a user-friendly interface to add, manage, and animate camera morphs, making it easier to create complex camera movements in Blender.

## Features

- **Add Morph Camera**: Easily add a new morph camera to the scene.
- **Camera Morph List**: Manage a list of cameras to morph between.
- **Morph Slider**: Control the morphing between cameras using a slider.
- **Arc Control**: Adjust the arc of the morphing path for more dynamic transitions.
- **Bake Morph Camera**: Bake the morphing animation into a new camera for further editing or rendering.
- **User Interface Panels**: Access the morph camera settings from both the Properties and 3D Viewport panels.
